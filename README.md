# Vending Machine Project
This is a Computer Organization and Assembly Language course-related project, where a vending machine is designed to allow users to:

1. Select from food categories such as:
   - Fast food
   - Pakistani food
   - Chinese food
   - Breakfast
   - Snacks
   - Sweets
   - Beverages

2. Upon selecting a category (e.g., Pakistani food), another menu appears with options like:
   - Biryani
   - Pulao
   - Chicken Bhuna
   - Mutton Bhuna
   - Plain Rice

3. In the next phase, the vending machine will allow the user to:
   - Enter an amount
   - Choose an item
   - Enter the quantity
   - Make a purchase
